# Cloudflare Tunnel Script

This bash script automates the creation and management of Cloudflare tunnels for exposing local applications to the internet. It simplifies the process of setting up a secure connection between your local server and Cloudflare's global network, allowing you to access your application via a custom domain.

## Features

* **Automated Tunnel Creation:** Creates a new Cloudflare tunnel if one doesn't already exist with the specified name.
* **Configuration File Generation:** Automatically generates a `cloudflared` configuration file (`cloudflared-<appname>.yml`) with the necessary settings, including the tunnel ID, credentials file path, origin certificate path, and ingress rules.
* **DNS Record Management:** Checks for an existing DNS record for your subdomain and creates one if it doesn't exist. This script assumes you want a DNS record of type `CNAME` that points to the cloudflare tunnel.
* **Background Execution with Logging:** Runs the `cloudflared` tunnel process in the background and redirects standard output and standard error to a log file (`<appname>-cloudflared.log`).
* **Process Management:** Saves the process ID (PID) of the running tunnel in a file (`<appname>-cloudflared.pid`) for easy stopping and restarting.
* **Process Verification:** Checks to make sure the tunnel started successfully.
* **Error Handling:** Provides informative error messages and exits if required arguments are missing, the Cloudflare origin certificate is not found, tunnel creation fails, or tunnel startup fails.
* **Existing Tunnel Management:** The script provides the functionality to stop and restart running tunnels associated with the specified `appname`.

## Prerequisites

* **Cloudflare Account:** You'll need a Cloudflare account and a domain registered with Cloudflare.
* **Cloudflared:** Install the `cloudflared` command-line tool. You can download it from the [Cloudflare website](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/get-started/download-cloudflared/).
* **Cloudflare Origin Certificate:** Authenticate with Cloudflare and download the origin certificate. This typically resides in `~/.cloudflared/cert.pem`. You can obtain the certificate using: `cloudflared tunnel login`.

## Usage

```bash
./cftunnel.sh <appname> <domain> <local-port>
```

* `<appname>`: The name of your application (used for the tunnel name, config file name, log file name, and subdomain). For instance, if your app is called "my-app", you would assign this to the appname.
* `<domain>`: Your domain (e.g., `example.com`).
* `<local-port>`: The port number your application is listening on locally (e.g., `3000`).

**Example:**

```bash
./tunnel.sh myapp example.com 3000
```

This will:
1. Check for the Cloudflare origin certificate.
2. Create a tunnel named `myapp-tunnel` (if it doesn't exist) using the Cloudflare API.
3. Generate a configuration file named `cloudflared-myapp.yml`.
4. Create a DNS record for `myapp.example.com` (if it doesn't exist), pointing to the Cloudflare tunnel.
5. Start the tunnel in the background.
6. Save the PID of the tunnel process to `myapp-cloudflared.pid`.
7. Log tunnel output to `myapp-cloudflared.log`.

## Script Breakdown

* **Argument Parsing:** Validates the presence of the required arguments (`appname`, `domain`, `local-port`).
* **Certificate Check:** Verifies the existence of the Cloudflare origin certificate file.
* **Tunnel Existence Check:** Determines if a tunnel with the specified name already exists using `cloudflared tunnel list` and `grep`.
* **Tunnel Creation:** Creates a new Cloudflare tunnel using `cloudflared tunnel create`.
* **Configuration File Generation:** Creates the `cloudflared-<appname>.yml` configuration file using a "here document" (`cat << EOF ... EOF`).
* **DNS Record Creation:** Creates the `CNAME` record to automatically route traffic.
* **Tunnel Startup:** Starts the `cloudflared tunnel run` command in the background using `&` and redirects standard output and standard error to a log file.
* **PID Management:** Saves the process ID to a file so the process can be managed easily.
* **Logging:** Redirects the tunnel's output to a file for debugging and monitoring.

## Important Considerations

* **Security:** This setup relies on Cloudflare's security features. Keep your `cloudflared` tool and Cloudflare account secure.
* **Dependencies:** Ensure you have `cloudflared` installed and configured correctly.
* **Firewall:** Make sure your firewall allows traffic to your application on the specified `<local-port>`.
* **Domain Configuration:** Your domain's nameservers must be pointed to Cloudflare for this script to work correctly. This step is outside the scope of this script.
* **Cleanup:** If you delete the Cloudflare tunnel through the Cloudflare dashboard, you might need to manually delete the DNS record created by the script.
* **Error Handling:** It's recommended to improve the error handling to better catch and report unexpected issues.
* **Stopping the Tunnel:** If you want to stop the script you can do this with `kill $(cat ${APPNAME}-cloudflared.pid)`.
